| [CalEnviro Screening 3.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30) | CalEnviroScreen is a screening tool that evaluates the burden of pollution from multiple sources in communities while accounting for potential vulnerability to the adverse effects of pollution. CalEnviroScreen ranks census tracts in California based on potential exposures to pollutants, adverse environmental conditions, socioeconomic factors and prevalence of certain health conditions. Data used in the CalEnviroScreen model come from national and state sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2017         |
| [CalPIP Pesticide Use Reporting](http://calpip.cdpr.ca.gov/main.cfm)                      | Welcome to the California Pesticide Information Portal (CalPIP). CalPIP allows you to query from more than one database, or data source, to find information on pesticide related issues. The general public, agricultural producers, environmental regulators, and public policy decision-makers are intensely interested in pesticide-related information about human health issues, food safety, environmental impacts, chemical properties, and agricultural practices. Governmental and private organizations use DPRâ€™s pesticide data to assess risk, food quality, worker exposure, endangered species protection, water and air quality, and to analyze pest management, and land use trends. CalPIP makes it easy for you to acquire pesticide use information formerly accessed by only large, technologically sophisticated organizations. This site allows you to run real-time queries on a 24-hour by 7-day basis about pesticide uses specific to your needs and interests. | 1991-2016    |
