# Pesticide Transparency Portal


## Purpose

Agriculture makes up a substantial portion of California's revenue. Current practice in this industry relies heavily on pesticide products, many of which have been determined to have detrimental effects to workers and the surrounding communities. This portal provides contextual analysis for citizens who would like to know more about what products are being used in their communities, the sensitive sites that are at risk of being effected by these products and contacts to raise awareness to various regulatory agencies who can enact changes.

| [CalEnviro Screening 3.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30)                          | CalEnviroScreen is a screening tool that evaluates the burden of pollution from multiple sources in communities while accounting for potential vulnerability to the adverse effects of pollution. CalEnviroScreen ranks census tracts in California based on potential exposures to pollutants, adverse environmental conditions, socioeconomic factors and prevalence of certain health conditions. Data used in the CalEnviroScreen model come from national and state sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2017         |

CalPIP allows you to query from more than one database, or data source, to find information on pesticide related issues. The general public, agricultural producers, environmental regulators, and public policy decision-makers are intensely interested in pesticide-related information about human health issues, food safety, environmental impacts, chemical properties, and agricultural practices. Governmental and private organizations use DPRâ€™s pesticide data to assess risk, food quality, worker exposure, endangered species protection, water and air quality, and to analyze pest management, and land use trends. CalPIP makes it easy for you to acquire pesticide use information formerly accessed by only large, technologically sophisticated organizations. This site allows you to run real-time queries on a 24-hour by 7-day basis about pesticide uses specific to your needs and interests. | 1991-2016    |
